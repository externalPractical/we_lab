Create a new file with a .jsp extension, such as helloworld.jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World JSP</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

Save the file.
To run the JSP, you need a web server that supports Java, such as Apache Tomcat.
Steps:-
1.	Copy the helloworld.jsp file into the webapps directory of your Tomcat installation. For example, if Tomcat is installed at C:\Tomcat, copy the file to C:\Tomcat\webapps.
2.	Start the Tomcat server.
3.	Open a web browser and access the JSP file by entering the URL http://localhost:8080/helloworld.jsp (assuming Tomcat is running on the default port 8080).
